#Edit the /etc/passwd file with the command "vipw"
#Add the following example user:
	testuser:x:5252:5253:This is a test user:/home/testuser:/bin/bash

#We can also add a new group with "vigr"
# I added the following group:
	testgroup:x:5253

#Create the home directory for the user and copy in it what's in /etc/skel
mkdir /home/testuser
cp -R /etc/skel/* /home/testuser/

#Now we need to change some permissions in the users home directory
cd /home/testuser
chown -R testuser .
chgrp -R testgroup .
chmod -R u=rwx,g=r,o= .

#And in the end set the password for the user
passwd testuser
#Note that the passwd command always uses encryption with "crypt" algorithm, so it is secured
